Referendum 2 (Petition 4) - Merging with Natania


This petition, if passed, will express the will of the majority of the populace of the Republic of Julia to merge with the Kingdom of Natania, a fellow Democratic Sim server that is interested in merging with Julia.

Originally petitioned by: Towarzys


—----------------------------------------
Referendum 3 (Petition 7) - Joke Petitions


Joke petitions are punishable by up to six hours time-out.


A petition that is intentionally created as a form of humor or satire, rather than a serious request for change or action. Often with playful demands, or mentions of non-politically related subjects that are not meant to be taken seriously by an average citizen.[b]

Referendum 8 (Petition 16) - Large Font Size in General Discussion

Ban people from randomly using the huge font size in general. It is 99% of the time used for spam, and it is unfair to crowd out everyone else's messages like that for no reason.

Originally petitioned by: Jash

—----------------------------------------
Referendum 11 (Petition 18) - Typos in Legal Documents


Every typo that the VP finds in a law document that is passed, from today onwards, means a fine of 1000 from the Bill writer. 


Going through the law documents, it's clear there's a huge lack of formatting, peer-reviewing, and basic literacy - I think this would be a great way to force people to check over what they're doing and make sure it makes sense, before submitting it to a vote. 


It will only be for obvious typos, like spelling mistakes or sentences that don't make sense - I won't be nitpicky about spacing, or whatever. Just common sense.

—----------------------------------------
Referendum 13 (Petition 22) - Tyler the Creator, Julia’s Official Artist


Officially recognize Tyler Gregory Okonma, known as Tyler, The Creator, as Julia's official artist.

—----------------------------------------
Referendum 19 (Petition 32) - Party Emojis


The admin team is legally required to add an emoji for every active Party.


Originally petitioned by: Bloppa


—----------------------------------------
Referendum 22 (Petition 39) - Mute/Ban/Kick 


Referendums and laws cannot Mute, Kick, or Ban someone. Only through criminal conviction by the Courts they may be removed.

—----------------------------------------
Referendum 23 (Petition 38) - Party Text Channels


All verified parties must have a party member only text channel in Julia, much like ISD or TPA.


Originally petitioned by: ARJester
—----------------------------------------
Referendum 25 (Petition 45) - Party Member Monthly Audits


It is very clear that the Party membership is inaccurate due to the massive number of inactive accounts. I propose that if a person in a Party is not active (defined as, sent a message in the last MONTH), that they have their Party role taken off. This way we get a far more accurate picture of ACTUAL Party numbers, so Party History etc. and election predictions are more meaningful. 


This would be done by, at the end of each month, a quick check by admins to ensure activity. Any accounts that are unroled will be publicly announced, so the Party has an opportunity to contest it if they wish. I know people really like 'big numbers', but believe me, this is going to be way more interesting and will improve the political health of Julia. 


This removes the advantage that old Parties have over new ones, since old Parties accumulate dead/abandoned accounts over time. It also means that totally dead Parties aren't 'forever verified' just because there are three dead accounts there."

Referendum 29 (Petition 46) - Senator Fine


Fine every Senator 1,000 credits every time they don’t vote on a bill. Can be waived if the Senator gives a proper reason. Proper reason to be defined as “deemed justifiable and reasonable based on the Senator’s ability to perform their duties.” Things such as family emergencies, health reasons, unforeseen circumstances, or technical issues.

—----------------------------------------
Referendum 31 (Petition 52) - Party Deletion


If no party member speaks in 15 days, then the party should be deleted.


Originally petitioned by: Heen

—----------------------------------------
Referendum 33 (Petition 54) - Julia Rose Medal of Honour


A new award called the 'Julia Rose Medal of Honour' should be created, with the President able to present a maximum of five (5) medals to those they deem worthy of the honour, for acts of service they have provided during the relevant Presidential administration. 


Each award will be followed by a decent paragraph from the President explaining how they have deserved it, and all will be announced in the final days of the Presidential term, before the next one begins. This is limited to Presidential term - not President - so if someone were to win two elections in a row, they are able to present two sets of medals in the final days of each one. Alternatively, if a President comes into power mid-way through an administration, there is still only one 'set' of awards able to be given at the end of it. 


This award will be accompanied with a gold 'Julia Rose Medal of Honour' role tag - but can be revoked if there is a specific disavowal by the President, or Senate, due to significant improper actions in future. The recipients of these medals will be mentioned in the Hall of Power moving forward, within each administration post. This is one way that we can reward and recognise those who contribute to the great nation of Julia.

Referendum 35 (Petition 56) - Spam


This referendum would make it illegal for someone to spam in any channel. “Spam” constitutes repeating the same or a similar message 4 or more times. 


Originally petitioned by: Metoo

Referendum 37 (Petition 59) - Starboard


This would allow the server to add a “starboard” channel that, if a message gets 5 star reactions, it will go on the starboard channel that will be caught by the starboard bot.

Referendum 39


(Petition 67) Create a "Debate" stage channel under the Voting category. This will allow everyone to listen and participate in discussions during debates.

REFERENDUM 40


(Petition 69) Every 27th day of the month is officially known as 'Presidential Peril Day' (PP Day for short), to recognise the fact that every 27th has been some form of massive disaster for the sitting President. Blight was dealing with Miku/EPIC Party on Jan 27. Medieval left the server after the infamous Feb 27 incident. Toast was impeached on March 27 by the Senate. This is clearly a day of national significance, and ought to be treated as such - much like how every 2nd of the month is Julia Day, to acknowledge our founding.
