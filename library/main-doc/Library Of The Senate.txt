LINK TO THE CONSTITUTION OF JULIA
LINK TO PASSED REFERENDUMS


The purpose of this document will be to serve as an up-to-date and accurate registry of every single legislation passed by the Senate, and thus may be used as a master document to refer to accurate versions of Laws.


All the laws will be divided into different categories and each category will have a separate document to aid in the ease of access and maintenance of these very docs. These categories have no legal meaning and are only meant to aid navigation.
