# Julia Legislation
This is a repository with a hard copy of the constitution, the referendum doc, the library of the senate and every section of the library of the senate. Each doc has a .pdf, .txt and .docx copy. If you want to load one of these files into google docs, use the .docx file. The .txt file is useful for comparing changes. I'll update this periodically. If I'm slow to update this repo, please feel free to make a pull request with the appropriate changes.
